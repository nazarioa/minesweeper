Minesweeper in light PHP
========================

A while back a friend of mine applied at a large "innovative" tech company
that shall not be named. We talked about the interview process and the sort of
questions he was asked.

He said that they only gave him one coding challenge, create Minesweeper in the
language of his choice -- for him it was Ruby in under 1 hour.

They only wanted the mechanics, not really the UI. The test was to see
how well the applicant knew the language, and more importantly how well does
the applicant know data structures and can foresee potential issues with a given
implementation.

Me being the curious fellow, decided I would try to repeat this exercise in
my lingua franca of PHP.

Most of what you see here I wrote in one hour and thirty minutes. I got stuck
on my recursive function -- in my defense it was the third to the last Warriors
game and I had all ready consumed a few beers when my friend and I spoke.

Time went on, the season ended, and I didn't work on this at all. Until the
last few days where I sat down and finished bits of this project. It was fun!
